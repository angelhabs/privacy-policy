- **Name**: When you create an account, we collect your name. This is stored in our database (Supabase) for account identification and subscription management. Additionally, your name is stored locally on your device for app functionality and personalization.

### Habit Data
- **Local Storage Only**: All habit data, progress tracking, daily completions, challenges, and personal information related to your habits are stored **exclusively on your device** using local storage (Core Data). This data is **never** transmitted to our servers or stored in the cloud.
- **Analytics Only**: For analytics purposes only, we log the **names** of habits you create (e.g., "Meditate", "Exercise"). We do **not** collect or store:
  - Progress values or completion percentages
  - Daily completion dates or history
  - Goal values or units
  - Rest days or schedules

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:
- **Email Address**: Manage your account and subscription status, identify users who have cancelled subscriptions for retention purposes, and provide customer support
- **Name**: Personalize your experience within the app. Your name is stored in our database (Supabase) for account identification and subscription management, and also stored locally on your device for app functionality.
- **Habit Names (Analytics Only)**: Understand which types of habits are popular among our users for product improvement purposes. Habit names are stored anonymously (not linked to your user account or any identifying information).

## Data Storage and Security

- **Habit Data**: All your habit data, progress tracking, daily completions, and challenges are stored **locally on your device** using Core Data. This data never leaves your device and is not backed up to our servers. If you delete the app, this data will be permanently deleted.
- **Email Address and Name**: Your email address and name are stored securely in our database (Supabase) for account and subscription management purposes. Additionally, your name is stored locally on your device for app functionality and persists across app sessions.
- **Data Location**: Our database is hosted by Supabase. Data may be stored in servers located outside your country of residence. We implement appropriate safeguards to protect your data in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
- **Security Measures**: We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information. Our database is hosted by Supabase, which implements industry-standard security practices.
- **Data Retention**: We retain your email address and name for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal information in accordance with applicable privacy laws and our standard practices, except where we are required to retain it for legal or regulatory purposes.
- However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Data Persistence and Account Changes

**Important**: All habit data, progress, and personal information are stored **locally on your device**. This means:

- **Logging Out**: If you log out of your account or use the logout feature, your locally stored habit data will **remain on your device**. Logging out does not delete your data.
- **Account Changes**: Entering a new email address or name will **not delete** your existing habit data. Your data remains stored locally on your device regardless of account changes.
- **Device Changes**: If you switch to a new device, your locally stored data will not automatically transfer. Data is stored on the specific device where you use the app.
- **Deleting Data**: Your locally stored data can only be permanently deleted by:
  1. Deleting the app from your device, or
  2. Using the "Delete All My Data" button available in the app under Menu > Privacy Policy > Privacy & Data Management

This behavior is intentional and designed to ensure that your habit tracking data persists unless you explicitly choose to delete it through one of the methods above.
